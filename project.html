                <br>An inquiry into borders and their representation</h1>

                <h5>Italian Limes explores how natural borders—apparently unquestionable and self-evident, are in fact exposed to the complexity of continuous ecological processes, unveiling the problem of territorial representation and its political implications. Starting from the initial research into the archives of Istituto Geografico Militare in Florence, this section unveils the topics behind the project, the design of the sensors installed on a glacier across the Alpine watershed, and the installation that tracks real-time shifts in the border.</h5></p>

                    <p>Italy’s terrestrial border unwinds for a total length of 1,913 km, mostly following the line of the natural watershed across the entire Alpine range. On rocky ridges and stable terrains, its contour is materialised through 8,043 boundary stones and metal plaques. On the snowfields and perennial glaciers that shape the watershed at higher altitudes, where permanent physical markers would be impossible, the only trace of the border is preserved in the official maps published by Istituto Geografico Militare, Italy’s national mapping agency.</p>

                    <p>The border’s path derives to a great extent from the provisions of the Treaty of Peace signed by Italy in 1947, after the end of the Second World War. Its short history reflects many facets of political developments in 20th-century Europe. While the border between Italy and Switzerland has not undergone great changes since the beginning of the 19th century, the one between Italy and Austria was extensively redrawn by the battles of the First World War and the one with France was altered by a number of “minor” territorial cessions at the end of the 1940s following the defeat of Fascist Italy in the war. The frontier with Slovenia, finally, is in fact the same as the one that separated Italy and Yugoslavia after 1954, the year when the Free Territory of Trieste ceased to exist.</p>

                    <p>Over the course of the last twenty years, almost every physical trace of these borders seems to have faded away: the frontiers that run through the Alps have undergone notable changes in their role and their nature. Up until the end of the last century, they defined a broad spectrum of international relations: from the friendly ties with France and Austria (NATO allies) to mediation with the economic and political enclave of Switzerland and the tightly-sealed border with the former Yugoslavia—<em>de facto</em>, the southernmost edge of the Iron Curtain. This scenario, today, seems to be a forgotten landscape, covered with the dust of the past.</p>

                    <p>The need for an accurate measurement of the national border has constantly driven the progress of technologies for spatial representation, from the early photogrammetry surveys of the 1920s, to the creation of trigonometric networks, to the final transition to digital co-ordinates of high-accuracy GPS measurements.</p>

                    <p>In some areas, such as the edge of the Po Basin, the edge of the range is unambiguous, but where the Alps border on other mountainous or hilly regions, the border may be harder to place.
