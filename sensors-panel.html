                    <p>The devices installed by the Italian Limes team are open-source surveying tools that have been conceived specifically for the project.</p>

                    <p>They have been designed under the scientific guidance of professor Valter Maggi (University of Milano–Bicocca), and professor Aldino Bondesan (University of Padua). Prior to the installation, the devices were tested at -30°C inside the facilites of EuroCold laboratories at University of Milano–Bicocca. They rely on technology and network connectivity provided by TIM.</p>
